<hr />

<p>
This page describes, in Unix manual page style,
<b>xd</b>, a utility which dumps files in hexadecimal,
decimal, or octal, with file addresses shown in any of
those formats.  <b>xd</b> can read files in any of the
formats it writes, recreating binary files, including
modifications made by editing the dump with any text
editor.  In addition, <b>xd</b> can transform a binary
file into a C data declaration which permits embedding
its contents into a program.  <b>xd</b> is available as
C source code compatible with most Unix systems.
</p>

<h3>NAME</h3>
<p>
     <b>xd</b> &ndash; extended dump and load utility
</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>
     <b>xd</b> [ <b>&minus;a</b><i>addrfmt</i> <b>&minus;c</b>
         <b>&minus;d</b><i>label</i> <b>&minus;l</b> <b>&minus;n</b><i>datafmt</i>
         <b>&minus;s</b> ] [ <i>infile</i> [  <i>outfile</i> ] ]
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
     <b>xd</b> dumps files in hexadecimal, decimal, or octal, optionally with
     ISO characters side by side.  File addresses can likewise be
     displayed in hex, decimal, or octal notation.
</p>

<p>
     <b>xd</b> can <em>read</em> dump files in the same formats it writes and create
     binary files from the data therein.  This allows you to dump a
     binary file with <b>xd</b>, edit it with your favourite text editor,
     then make a new binary file containing whatever changes you've
     made.  When creating a binary file, <b>xd</b> normally assumes you've
     only modified data in place (neither expanding nor contracting
     the file) and verifies file addresses to guarantee this.
     However, a "stream" option is available which ignores file
     addresses so you're free to insert and delete bytes at will.  <b>xd</b>
     thus turns your existing text editor into a binary file editor
     without requiring you to learn any new commands.
</p>

<p>
     Finally, <b>xd</b> can read a binary file and emit a C language data
     declaration which contains the data from the file.  This is handy
     when you wish to embed binary data within C programs.
</p>

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>

<dl class="options">
<dt><b>&minus;a</b><i>addrfmt</i></dt>
    <dd>Displays addresses in the dumped file as specified by
        <i>addrfmt</i>: <b>d</b> for decimal, <b>h</b> or
        <b>x</b> for hexadecimal, and <b>o</b> for octal.  By
        default, addresses are shown in hexadecimal.</dd>

<dt><b>&minus;c</b></dt>
    <dd>Display ISO characters alongside the numeric
        dump.  Non-printing characters (according to ISO
        8859/1) are shown as periods.  The ISO characters are
        separated from the dump by vertical bar characters,
        which <b>xd</b> treats as comment delimiters when loading a
        file.</dd>

<dt><b>&minus;d</b><i>label</i></dt>
    <dd>Dumps the file as a C language declaration of  an array
        of <tt>unsigned char</tt> which, when compiled, will
        contain the same data as the binary input file.  The C
        array declaration is given the variable name
        <i>label</i>, or <tt>xd_data</tt> if no label
        specification is given.  Data are declared as individual
        bytes to guarantee portability across architectures with
        different byte ordering conventions, and are expressed
        as decimal numbers in lines of less than 80 characters
        for maximum portability among compilers.  The C operator
        <tt>sizeof</tt> may be applied to the array <i>label</i>
        to obtain its length in bytes.</dd>

<dt><b>&minus;l</b></dt>
    <dd>Load file from dump.  <b>xd</b> reads a file in the same
        format it writes, creating a binary output file.  Each
        line is assumed to begin with a file address terminated
        by a colon.  Data bytes are separated by white space,
        and any characters after a vertical bar are ignored
        (thus discarding any ISO characters included in the dump
        with the <b>&minus;c</b> option).  If the
        <b>&minus;s</b> option is not specified, each file
        address is checked against the number of bytes written
        so far to guarantee that no bytes have been added or
        deleted.  Files must be loaded with the <b>&minus;a</b>
        and <b>&minus;n</b> options set the same as when the
        file was dumped.</dd>

<dt><b>&minus;n</b><i>datafmt</i></dt>
    <dd>Edits bytes in the dumped file as specified by
        <i>datafmt</i>: <b>d</b> for decimal, <b>h</b> or
        <b>x</b> for hexadecimal, and <b>o</b> for octal.  By
        default, bytes are shown in hexadecimal.</dd>

<dt><b>&minus;s</b></dt>
    <dd>Stream input when loading file.  If  this  option is
        specified in conjunction with the <b>&minus;l</b> option, file
        addresses are not verified when loading a file and, in
        fact, need not be specified at all.  The input file is
        treated as a stream of byte values separated by white
        space.  This option allows you to create a dump with
        <b>xd</b>, edit it as you wish with any text editor,
        inserting and deleting bytes in the file wherever you
        like, then create a binary file from the modified dump
        with the command <b>xd &minus;l &minus;s</b> <i>dumpfile
        outfile</i>.</dd>

<dt><b>&minus;u</b></dt>
    <dd>Print how-to-call information.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>FILES</h3>
<p>
     If no <i>infile</i> is specified, <b>xd</b> obtains its
     input from standard input; if no <i>outfile</i> is given,
     output is sent to standard output. The input and output are
     processed in a strictly serial manner regardless of
     options; consequently <b>xd</b> may be used in pipelines
     without restrictions.
</p>

<h3>BUGS</h3>
<p>
     Input error checking in load mode might be improved.  Note
     that each byte in load mode must be specified as a number
     in the same format selected by the <b>&minus;n</b> option
     when the file was dumped, separated by white space, and
     that the <b>&minus;a</b> and <b>&minus;n</b> options must
     be set the same when loading a file as when it was dumped.
