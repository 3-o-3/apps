                           Development Log

2000 August 29

Added _WIN32 code to xd.c to set input and output text/binary
modes and force modes of standard input and output depending on
the operation being performed.  Input is set to binary except
when a "-l" option load is selected, in which case the input
file is text mode and the output is binary.

Remade logo using Snap ITC font as before, changing background
colour to be white as used in the updated HTML file.  Note that
due to an error in this font's bounding box calculation one
must prefix "XD" with a space to avoid truncation of the left
part of the "X".

Version 1.3.

2017 October 16

Updated Makefile so that the test target works with current versions
of Linux.  The options on "tail" have changed since Solaris days in
2000, and we need to include <unistd.h> in the embedded test program
to avoid natters from GCC.  Added -Wall to C compiler options.

Eliminated Win32 binaries from the release.  They, like the operating
system on which they ran and its regrettable vendor, are impotent and
obsolete.

Removed "lint" target from Makefile.  It's obsolete.

Removed "zip" target.  We don't support legacy systems.

Cleaned up "tar" target to use tar's built in gzip and renamed
to "dist".

Renamed the "test" target to the more standard "check".

Modified the individual test targets to create their temporary
files in the working directory instead of /tmp, and to clean
up the temporary files at the end of each test.

Version 1.4.
